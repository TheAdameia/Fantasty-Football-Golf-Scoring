8/31: Project created. User secrets initialized. PSQL server not yet created (need all my classes to do that).
9/16: I think I'm coming up on the end of ironing out the models. Well, the non-DTO models, that is. Unfortunately I think the icky part (making everything in the DbContext) is next, because it would be a fool's errand to work on controllers or managers when you don't have anything to test them with. The good news is, once I create the database, the world is really my oyster and I can develop this in more or less whatever order I want. Just realized I don't have (actual nfl) teams or bye weeks in my data structure. Don't have any bright ideas on how to handle team changes either. I think I will leave those bugbears for later; I doubt solving those will result in drastic changes to what I already have. More important to figure out how to get all that data so I can get a chatbot to format it for me.
9/17: after research, I was able to find data but it would be a pain to get all the scores. Easier to have the chatbot fabricate some basic stuff for me.
