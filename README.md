# Fantasy Golfball
Alternatively, Fantasy Football with Golf Scoring (lowest score wins)

## But why?
Fantasy Golfball is a proof of concept fantasy football creation that is meant to ultimately be able to host a service for those that want to play fantasy football with a quirky, irreverent ruleset.

## Technologies Used
- React/JS
- C#/.NET
- EFC
- PSQL
- reactstrap
- CSS

## Where is the project at now and where is it going?
The project is currently at the point where the UI and page structure are being fleshed out. After the UI is at a bare minimum level, functionality will be added so that database testing and simulated seasons can begin. Pending that testing and functionality, in-house testing with a group of beta testers will begin. After that, the project will continue development with an eye on becoming a public-facing web service.

## Disclosures
I don't own football (does anybody?). All data used is either fabricated for testing purposes or gathered from public sources on the internet. I do not profit from this project.
